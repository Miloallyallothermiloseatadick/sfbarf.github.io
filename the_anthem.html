THE SECOND BOOK OF THE COURTIER 
BY COUNT BALDESAR CASTIGLIONE </a>
</p>
<p>TO MESSER ALFONSO ARIOSTO 
</p>
<span style="font-family: 'Courier'; font-size: 14px;">
<p>
I have often considered not without wonder whence arises 
a fault, which, as it is universally found among old people, may 
be believed to be proper and natural to them. And this is, that 
they nearly all praise bygone times and censure the present, 
inveighing against our acts and ways and everything which 
they in their youth did not do; affirming too that every good 
custom and good manner of living, every virtue, in short every 
thing, is always going from bad to worse. 
</p><p>
And verily it seems quite contrary to reason and worthy to be 
wondered at, that ripe age, which in other matters is wont to 
make men's judgment more perfect with long experience, should 
in this matter so corrupt it that they do not perceive that if the 
world were always growing worse, and if fathers were generally better than children, we should long since have reached 
that last grade of badness beyond which it is impossible to grow 
worse. And yet we see that not only in our days but in bygone 
times this failing has always been peculiar to old age, which is 
clearly gathered from the works of many ancient authors, and 
especially of the comic writers, who better than the others set 
forth the image of human life. 
</p><p>
Now the cause of this wrong judgment among old people I 
for my part take to be, that the fleeting years despoil them of 
many good things, and among others in great part rob the 
blood of vital spirits; whence the complexion changes, and 
those organs become weak through which the soul exerts its 
powers. Thus in old age the sweet flowers of contentment fall 
from our hearts, like leaves from a tree in autumn, and in place 
of serene and sunny thoughts, comes cloudy and turbid sadness 
with its train of thousand ills. So that not the body only but 
the mind also is infirm; of bygone pleasures naught is left but a 
lingering memory and the image of that precious time of tender 
youth, in which (when it is with us) sky and earth and all things 
seem to us ever making merry and laughing before our eyes, 
and the sweet springtide of happiness seems to blossom in our 
thought, as in a delightful and lovely garden. </span>

<p>
... Thus it seems to me 
that old people are in like case with those who keep their eyes 
fixed upon the land as they leave port, and think their ship 
is standing still and the shore recedes, although it is the other 
way. For both the port and also time and its pleasures remain 
the same, and one after another we take flight in the ship of 
mortality upon that boisterous sea which absorbs and devours 
everything, and are never suffered to touch shore again, but 
always tossed by adverse winds we are wrecked upon some 
rock at last. 
</p><p>
Since therefore the senile mind is an unfit subject for many 
pleasures, it cannot enjoy them; and just as to men in fever, 
when the palate is spoiled by corrupt vapours, all wines seem 
bitter, however precious and delicate they be, <b>so old men, 
because of their infirmity</b> (which yet does not deprive them of 
appetite), <b>find pleasures flat and cold and very different from 
those which they remember tasting of old, although the pleasures are intrinsically the same. 
Thus they feel themselves despoiled, and they lament and call the present times bad, not 
perceiving that the change lies in themselves and not in the 
times; </b>and on the other hand they call to mind their bygone 
pleasures, and bring back the time when these were enjoyed 
and praise it as good, because it seems to carry with it a savour 
of what they felt when it was present. For in truth our minds 
hold all things hateful that have been with us in our sorrows, 
and love those that have been with us in our joys.
