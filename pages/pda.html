    <h3><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Too+long+didn%27t+read">TL;DR</a></h3>
    <p>In most states, property taxes go to local governments. In California, <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2012/tax/property-tax-primer-112912.aspx">most propery tax revenue, in most cities and towns, goes to the state and county</a>, and not to the local government. <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/2000/020300_ab8/020300_ab8.html">This makes towns not want to build housing.</a> (SF is a special case. SF receives over 60% of its property tax revenue, which is why the SF local government likes building housing). Towns would rather build office and retail, because those uses allow them to collect sales tax and property tax. The result - <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.pdf">30 years of underbuilding residential in all of California.</a></p>
    <p>In response, CA established <a href="http://www.hcd.ca.gov/hpd/housing_element2/GS_beforeYouBegin.php">Housing Element Law.</a> First, the <a href="http://www.hcd.ca.gov/">California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)</a> determines how many housing units each region should plan to build in the next 20 years. In 2007, HCD's projection was over 900,000 units. Then, a negotiation begins. <blink style="color:red;">Alert: Opportunity for citizen lobbying</blink> The HCD offers this number to the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). ABAG is made up of mayors, supervisors, council people, representitives from trade organizations and non-profits from around the Bay Area. ABAG responds with a lower number. After negotiations, the 2007 number of new units was reduced to <a href="http://www.sfbarf.org/files/pbac.pdf">660,000</a>. <span style="color:green;">Renters' Fed Goal: 2015 regional number closer to initial HCD offer</span></p>
    <p>Once the overall number is negotiated, ABAG develops a Regional Housing Need Plan (RHNA Plan) allocating the region’s share of the statewide housing need to each city and county within the region. <blink style="color:red;">Alert: Opportunity for citizen lobbying</blink> These are supposed to be <i>minimums</i>, but they are often treated as <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/29885-chasing-unicorns-5-reasons-why-san-francisco-is-delusional-giving-up-public-land-for-market-rate-development#">maximums</a>. Look at item 3 in the linked article. "The city is overproducing luxury housing." <br>
    "wow!" You might think, "SF has too many high priced units? Property managers are having trouble renting $3000/ mo 1 bedrooms? Developers of high proced products are going bankrupt? There are buildings full of empty units in SF? Landlords are cutting rents? Ellis act evictions are at zero?" <br>
    No, of course not, that's absurd. Units are still being rented as fast as they can be produced, and when the newly produced units run out, high income residents are putting out rent-controlled renters indirectly via Ellis Act evictions. It's as bad now as ever. In what sense, then, is SF "overproducing" luxury housing? How can a sentient writer craft such a sentence? Only if he is treating the RHNA for luxury units as a <i>maximim</i>. The notion that SF has overproduced high priced housing is used as a reason to oppose new market rate development. <span style="color:green;">Renters' Fed Goal: Disrupt this line of argument. Since people are treating the RHNA numbers as maximums, lobby for higher numbers in each category. Point out at every opportunity that the RHNA numbers are <i>minimums</i>.</span></p>
    <p>Each city and town receives their RHNA and then must write a Housing Element. The housing element contains all kinds of information and political verbage, but it also must contain a plan for the town to build their allocation. Some towns, like Oakland, do it right. Oakland <a href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PBN/OurOrganization/PlanningZoning/OAK028334">rezoned and wrote area EIRs</a> to make room for new housing. In West Oakland, for instance, Oakland increased height limits and rezoned some industrial to residential. Many towns, however, <a href="http://apps.mtc.ca.gov/meeting_packet_documents/agenda_2404/04_Affordable_Housing_PerspectiveNA.pdf">try to snake the process</a>. They designate "Priority Development Areas," where their RHN Allocation is supposed to be built. But, they might not rezone the area for the height or density needed to actually achieve their allocation, or the zoning is correct, but the permits are discretionary, and if a developer actually tries to develop there, the town can deny his permit (HAPPENING NOW IN FOSTER CITY). Or, the plan calls for a type of building that is too expensive to be realistic given the area's prevailing rents and land costs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD5zMBk-H98&feature=youtu.be">Here is an hour long presentation on this topic.</a> <blink style="color:red;">Alert: Opportunity for citizen lobbying</blink>. <span style="color:green;">Renters' Fed Goal: Realistic Housing Elements.</span> <span style="color:purple;">Renters' Fed Action: We went to the meeting in the above video, testified about our goal.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Once the housing element is crafted, containing PDAs of varying quality, the towns send their housing elements to the State of CA, in exchange for transportation funding. </p>
    <p>Sometimes, after the PDA is submitted, cities will try to pass a housing moratorium, <a href="http://www.sfbarf.org/files/emeryville_moratorium.pdf">putting themselves in violation of their housing elements.</a> Walnut Creek and Emeryville did this recently. Luckily, neither moratorium passed, because both cities were aware that they risked losing their state transportation money. Foster City, currently, is trying to enjoy the affects of a moratorium, without declaring one officially. They have figured out they can enforce an informal moratorium by refusing to entitle projects one by one.</p>

    <h2>Talking Points</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Extrapolating from population is the wrong methodology. We should measure demand instead</h3>

    <p>The 2014-2022 RHNA says this about the methodology:</p>

    <p>HCD determined that the Bay Area must plan for 187,990 new housing units from 2014‐2022 (Appendix A). This
      determination is based on population projections produced by the California Department of Finance (DOF)</p>

    <p>For the past few decades, population growth was limited by growth in housing stock, which hasn't kept up with
      demand. If the regional housing need assesment (RHNA) is extrapolated from housing-shortage-limited population
      growth, then expect more housing shortages in the future. Measure demand directly, instead of
      extrapolating from past growth. If enough housing for our children and all the people who want to
      live here isn't built, then people will get displaced.</p>

    <p>The LAO report outlines the economics and scope of this problem: <a
        href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Detail/3214">LINK</a>.
      This means that the true regional housing need is MUCH, MUCH larger than the estimated RHNA.</p>

    <h3>ABAG measures the number of units entitled instead of number of units that get built.</h3>

    <p>The solution is to base the MTC incentives on completed units instead of entitled units. A significant fraction
      of entitled units are constructed. Entitled units can only meet regional housing
      needs if they are actually constructed.</p>

    <h3>When RHNA breaks out housing needs by area median income it's misleading</h3>

    <p>Market-rate housing is somewhat fungible under shortage conditions. The solution is to make the RHNA AMI tiers match subsidized/BMR
      tiers, and then put all of the market-rate housing allocation into one bucket without an income breakdown.</p>

    <p>Putting all the market-rate housing in the same tier is a more realistic representation because it matches market
      conditions. In the current housing shortage, buyers and renters are all bidding against each other for scarce
      housing, no matter their income.</p>

    <p>Putting housing needs in different RHNA categories obfuscates the issue, which is that rich people get first pick at
      market-rate housing. There's no intrinsic difference between market-rate housing for high earners and
      middle-income earners, except that the middle-income earners lose bidding wars. Putting the market-rate allocation
      needs into one big market-rate bucket would accurately represent the problem to policymakers and the public.</p>

    <h3>Tiered RHNA requirements do make sense for below-market rate units</h3>

    <p>Those units are really in a different category than market-rate ones. The solution is make sure that RHNA
      tiers map to real tiers, not made-up distinctions. ABAG's RHNA tiers should match BMR tiers.</p>
