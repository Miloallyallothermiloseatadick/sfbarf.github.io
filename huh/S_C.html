<h1 style="color:white;position:absolute;left:30%;">SHOPPING CART OUTRAGE!<h1>

<h2 style="color:white;position:absolute;top:5%;left:30.5%;">LOCAL GENIUS OR CRAZY PERSON?</h2>

<p style="color:white;position:absolute;top:10%;left:10%;"><font size=5>Why are shopping carts increasing in size? Is this <b>the end</b> of small shopping carts as we know it?.</font></p>


<p style="position:absolute;top:25%;font-size:18px;padding:2px;background-color:#FFEEEE;width:30%;">I interviewed a Local Complainer about the increase of shopping carts at the Berkeley Bowl. 
Many people have complained about the increasing shopping cart size.
Its become a huge problem in the world of light shoppers.<br><br> People who buy fewer groceries would usually rather have an easily maneuverable cart
so they can get the few groceries they came there to buy. This problem is driving people to desperate measures and this is the story of one such desperate shopper who took matters into her own hands. </p>
 
<p style="position:absolute;top:25%;font-size:18px;padding:2px;background-color:#FFEEEE;width:30%;">Local Complainer : <br> Every time I go to Berkeley Bowl I go to customer service and ask them to get smaller 
shopping carts. The first time I even asked about it the guy said, "Have bigger shopping carts? Yeah, I know."
 This shows that more people have complained about the abominable size of the shopping cart. The last time I went there the guy said, "We're not getting smaller shopping carts because the big ones make you want to buy more food." Local genius got discouraged so I
 realized I was on my own and stopped complaining.<br><br> 
 
 Fast forward to Friday night. It was dark and stormy and I got off work pretty late.
 I drove to my friends house and I was going to park. It was trash night so there were trash cans out. When I pulled up I noticed that 
what I had before thought was a trash can was one of those half sized shopping carts that I had wanted so badly! I couldn't believe my luck. 
I was sure it was going to be broken but it was not. I was soaked by then. I found out it worked perfectly so I put it in the backseat of 
my 1991 Volkswagen cabriolet and took it home. <br><br>I don't mind leaving the better sized shopping cart outside Berkeley Bowl with my combination lock
 so others can use it. Contact me and I'll tell you the combination.  </p>

<p style="padding:2px;position:absolute;top:50%;left:40%;background-color:#FFEEEE;width:50%;"> This table shows the different sizes of shopping carts. The best shopping cart is highlighted in green and is displayed above the table. As you can see it is a lot smaller but has the most space to place our groceries. With its two fantastic levels it makes for an easily maneuverable, small but secretly large("shhhhhhh") shopping cart that your WHOLE family will love!</p>
